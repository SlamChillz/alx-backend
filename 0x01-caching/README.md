# Caching

The learning objectives of this project are:

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means
- What LIFO means
- What LRU means
- What MRU means
- What LFU means
- What the purpose of a caching system
- What limits a caching system have

## 0. Basic dictionary 
Create a class `BasicCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class `BaseCaching`
- This caching system doesn’t have limit
- `def put(self, key, item):`
  - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
  - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`.

## 1. FIFO caching
Create a class `FIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class `BaseCaching`
- You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don’t forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`
- `def put(self, key, item):`
    - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the item value for the key `key`.
    - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    - If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher that `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
        - you must discard the first item put in cache (FIFO algorithm)
        - you must print `DISCARD:` with the `key` discarded and following by a new line
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to key.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`.

## 2. LIFO Caching
Create a class `LIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
- You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don’t forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`
- `def put(self, key, item):`
    - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    - If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher that `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
        - you must discard the last item put in cache (LIFO algorithm)
        - you must print `DISCARD:` with the `key` discarded and following by a new line
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`

## 3. LRU Caching
Create a class `LRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
- You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don’t forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`
- `def put(self, key, item):`
    - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    - If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher that `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
        - you must discard the least recently used item (LRU algorithm)
        - you must print `DISCARD:` with the `key` discarded and following by a new line
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`

## 4. MRU Caching
Create a class `MRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
- You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don’t forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`
- `def put(self, key, item):`
    - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    - If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher that `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
        - you must discard the most recently used item (MRU algorithm)
        - you must print `DISCARD:` with the `key` discarded and following by a new line
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`

## 100. LFU Caching
Create a class `LFUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system:

- You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
- You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don’t forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`
- `def put(self, key, item):`
    - Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    - If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    - If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher that `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
        - you must discard the least frequency used item (LFU algorithm)
        - if you find more than 1 item to discard, you must use the LRU algorithm to discard only the least recently used
        - you must print `DISCARD:` with the `key` discarded and following by a new line
- `def get(self, key):`
    - Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    - If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn’t exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`
